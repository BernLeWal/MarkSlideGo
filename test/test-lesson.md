# Exercise introduction


This exercise activity is to get used to the Practice Exercise lesson activity in moodle, which you must follow in the class.

You can try it out here, to get used to it. This does not take part in your grading.

**Pre-Info for the Practices:**

* The practice-exercise must be executed according to that lesson. This lesson is a MUST-HAVE: not taking place at this Moodle-lesson, or not answering any of the questions leads to 0 pts for the whole exercise.
* Within the practice-class the lecturer will once be at your desk for a few minutes and oraly talk about the status of your lesson, asking you question(s). It is mandatory to document the lecturer's question and feedback.
* At the end of the practice, the complete ZIP-Archive of the project must be submitted. It MUST contain also the .git directory. This is a MUST-HAVE, so a missing submission leads to 0 pts grade of that practice-exercise
* It is not allowed to use AI like ChatGPT, CoPilot, etc.! Failure to do so will result in a complete loss of points. 

Agree with that rules to go on with the next page.

**Mandatory:**
* use Maven as build system!
* ensure that a local git repository is created (that's the default in IntelliJ)

When done go on to the next page to answer some questions about the code you have generated.
